ND CSE 40438: High-Frequency Trading Technologies Team 5 Final Project 
### Dagny Brand, Zach Brown, and Patrick Schlosser

## Abstract
We will design a system that parses press releases by the Federal Reserve Board, focusing on the federal funds rate, after each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, estimates its market impact, and determines the horizon within which this must be traded. We will begin by exploring the relationship between (1) the rate change and its effect on the stock market and (2) the relationship between the difference in expected and actual rates on the stock market. With this information, we will craft a strategy to predict the market’s movements based on the release’s contents. A program will pull the press release when available, parse it, and then use this strategy to make a decision. The results of this strategy will be backtested assuming sufficient speed and then the necessary speed to capitalize will be investigated.
